# Realtime WebRTC Demo

This minimal project demonstrates how to start a WebRTC session with the OpenAI Realtime API using an ephemeral key generated by a small Express server.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- An OpenAI API key with access to the Realtime API preview

## Setup

1. Copy the environment template and fill in your key:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

4. Open your browser at <http://localhost:3000> and press **Connect** to initiate a session.

## Configuration

The server reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment. The key is used only on the server to create short-lived session tokens as described in the [OpenAI Realtime guides](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-conversations).

## Notes

- This is a minimal demo intended for local experimentation and does not include advanced error handling or production hardening.
- Do not expose your API key to the client; the server acts as a secure middle layer.
